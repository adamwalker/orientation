# Orientation

This package exports a [Consumer](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes) that uses OpenGL to render a 3D object specified by the given vertices and normals. The orientation of the object may be repeatedly updated and the object redrawn in real time by feeding a quaternion to the Consumer.
